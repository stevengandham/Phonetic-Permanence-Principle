Phonetic Permanence Principle (3P) Project

is a new way to format English words to emphasize or silence the enunciation of letters in the already established spelling of a word.

This representation can prove useful for non-native English speakers in learning the English language, only knowing the basic English alphabet and some commonly used digraphs (two letters that make one sound).

Common Digraphs Include:
ch
sh
th
wh
ph
st
ce

There are 3 rules:

1) Pre-Superscript/Superscript formats are used for letters that are included in the spelling but are silent in pronunciations. (Pre-Superscripts are used prior to a base letter, s.t. no letters precede it; they usually indicate the beginning of a word where the first letter is silent).

2) Subscript formats are used for letters that are in the general spelling of the word, but are not necessarily enunciated. This is used for words s.t. there are two or more pronunciations.

3) Capital letter formats are used for letters in a word that are enunciated as they are pronounced in the alphabet as a standalone letter.
